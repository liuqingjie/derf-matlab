Instructions:

1 file DERF.m has the main function.

2 function compute_DERF produces the feature vector for the input image patch extracted from interest point.

3 function init_DERF serves as computing the DoG convolution gradient orientation maps.

4 function get_descriptors assembles the feature vector from DoG convolution gradient orientation maps.

Note: The major part of this code is implemented by Dawei Weng, and some basic functions are directly borrowed from the Daisy descriptor.
